# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
This is a Python project to visualize various sorting algorithms using Pygame.
The visualization is the central point of the program rather than the time to completion. Since this program uses a small list of numbers to sort, it will give the impression that algorithms such as Merge Sort may be less efficient than selection sort. 

## Features
- Visualizes Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Shell Sort and Merge Sort.
- Allows the user to toggle between ascending/descending order.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pygame

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-algorithm-visualizer
2. Create local environment
3. Install requirements.txt
